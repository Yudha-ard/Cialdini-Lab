# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION
#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

          Backend Course CRUD endpoints sudah ada sebelumnya:
          - POST /api/admin/courses - Create course
          - PUT /api/admin/courses/{course_id} - Update course

          - GET /api/courses - Get all courses
          - GET /api/courses/{course_id} - Get single course
          
          Models sudah mendukung Course, CourseModule, dan CourseSlide dengan struktur lengkap.
          Perlu testing untuk memastikan semua endpoint bekerja dengan benar, terutama untuk:
          1. Create course dengan modules dan slides
          2. Update course dengan perubahan modules
          3. Delete course

          ✅ AUTHENTICATION: Admin login successful with proper token and role validation
          ✅ GET /api/courses: Successfully retrieves all courses with proper structure validation
          ✅ POST /api/admin/courses: Creates courses with complete nested structure (modules & slides)
          ✅ GET /api/courses/{id}: Retrieves single course with full module and slide data
          ✅ PUT /api/admin/courses/{id}: Updates courses including adding/modifying modules
          ✅ DELETE /api/admin/courses/{id}: Properly deletes courses and returns 404 on subsequent access
          
          EDGE CASES TESTED:
          ✅ Empty modules array - Accepted and handled correctly
          ✅ Multiple modules (3-4) with multiple slides - Full structure preserved
          ✅ Unauthorized access protection - Returns 403 without valid admin token
          ✅ Non-existent course handling - Returns 404 appropriately
          
          VALIDATION VERIFIED:
          ✅ Required fields present in all responses (id, title, description, category, difficulty)
          ✅ Module numbering consistency maintained
          ✅ DateTime fields properly serialized
          ✅ created_by field populated correctly
          ✅ Course ID preservation during updates
          
          ISSUE FOUND & FIXED:
          - Fixed critical bug in PUT /api/admin/courses/{id} where course ID was being overwritten
          - Added logic to exclude 'id' field from update payload to preserve original course ID
          
          COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS:
          - Authentication: ✅ PASS
          - Create Course: ✅ PASS (with complex nested structure)
          - Read Single Course: ✅ PASS
          - Update Course: ✅ PASS (including module additions)
          - Delete Course: ✅ PASS
          - List All Courses: ✅ PASS
          - Edge Cases: ✅ PASS (empty modules, unauthorized access, non-existent course)
          
          All Course CRUD API endpoints are fully functional and ready for production use.

          ❌ QUIZ MODE SINGLE-PLAY RESTRICTION UI TESTING RESULTS:
          ❌ Authentication Issue: Unable to access quiz page due to route protection
          ❌ Page redirects to landing page when not authenticated
          ❌ Cannot verify "Already Completed" screen without proper login
          ❌ Cannot verify warning messages and UI elements
          
          AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
          - Login form appears to accept credentials but doesn't redirect to dashboard
          - All protected routes (/quiz, /spot-the-phishing, /challenges) redirect to landing page
          - Frontend route protection is working (good security) but prevents UI testing
          - Backend API calls are working (confirmed from logs) but frontend auth flow has issues
          
          RECOMMENDATION:
          - Main agent should investigate frontend authentication flow
          - Check token storage and validation in AuthContext
          - Verify login API response handling
          - Test with working credentials or fix auth flow

          Implemented single-play restriction for Spot the Phishing mini game:
          - Added AuthContext and API imports, axios
          - Added checkCompletionStatus() to call GET /api/minigame/completion-status/spot_the_phishing on mount
          - Added submitGameCompletion() to call POST /api/minigame/complete on game end
          - Added "completed" game state and "Already Completed" screen
          - Shows previous results: score, time_taken, emails_answered, lives_remaining
          - Warning message: user can only play mini game once
          - endGame() now submits completion data to backend

          Menambahkan fitur Course CRUD di AdminPanelNew.jsx:
          1. ✅ Menambahkan state: courses, showCreateCourseDialog, editingCourse
          2. ✅ Update fetchData() untuk fetch courses dari /api/courses
          3. ✅ Menambahkan tab "Courses" di TabsList (mengubah grid dari 3 ke 4 kolom)
          4. ✅ Membuat TabsContent untuk Courses dengan:
             - Tabel list courses (judul, kategori, tingkat, jumlah modules, durasi)
             - Action buttons: Edit & Delete
             - Create Course button dengan dialog
          5. ✅ Membuat CourseForm component dengan fitur lengkap:
             - Basic info: title, description, category, difficulty, total_duration_minutes
             - Prerequisites management (add/remove)
             - Learning outcomes management (add/remove)
             - Modules management dengan nested structure:
               * Setiap module punya: module_number, title, description, slides[]
               * Add/remove module functionality
               * Setiap module bisa add/remove slides
             - Slides management:
               * Setiap slide punya: title, content, code_example, image_url
               * Dynamic add/remove per module
          6. ✅ Form support untuk Create dan Edit mode
          7. ✅ handleDeleteCourse function dengan konfirmasi
          
          Perlu testing UI untuk memastikan:
          - Tab Courses muncul dan navigasi berfungsi
          - Form Create Course bisa add modules dan slides
          - Edit Course memuat data dengan benar
          - Delete Course berfungsi dengan konfirmasi
